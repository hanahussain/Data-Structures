# Dijkstra's Algorithm
An implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path between 2 nodes

### Purpose 
This program computes the shortest path between two destinations in a map

### Running Instructions
Download the .zip file and extract all the files. In a Linux environment (Windows PowerShell, Git Bash, etc), enter the command `make run` to start the program. 
Between runs, you may enter the command `make clean` to clean out output files.
